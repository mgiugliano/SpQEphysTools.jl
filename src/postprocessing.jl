- filename (String): the name of the file to write to.

	active_el()

This function calculates the number of "active electrodes" given the preprocessed recorded (spike timing) data.
Following the work of Prof. Dr. Shimon Marom (Technion, Haifa), an "active electrode" is conventionally defined as an electrode that records at least one spike every 50 seconds (i.e., active with a frequency >0.02 Hz).

### Arguments
- fname of preprocessed data file, containing the spike times (i.e. *.dat/spk.txt) (String)
- threshold (in Hz) to define an active electrode (Float64)

plot_raster(pathname::String, fraction::Float64)

Plot the raster plot of the spike times, for each fraction of the total recording time.
The function generates one or more PDF figures, storing them in the folder `figs` within the input `pathname`.

### Arguments
